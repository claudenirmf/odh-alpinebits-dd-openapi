    description: Filters resources in the endpoint based on "label-specific" or
      "simple generic" filters. Label-specific filters have their behavior and
      syntax defined by the server (e.g., a filter for resources available in
      desired languages, `filter[lang]=eng,ita,deu`). Simple generic filters
      combine a field (among the fields in the resources present in `data`) and
      a logical operand (e.g., filter resources with a last update value greater
      than a certain date, `filter[lastUpdate][gt]=2021-04-01`). The operands
      and their behavior is defined by the standard. Filters may refer to nested
      fields (e.g., `filter[name.eng][exists]=true`). If the server is unable
      process any filter, it shall respond with `400 Bad Request`.
