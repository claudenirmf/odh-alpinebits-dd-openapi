    description: >
      Search requests retrieve resources containing a search string
      in one or any of its textual fields which may consider all available
      languages. Searches in specific fields must specify one of the fields of
      the resource types present in `data` (e.g., `search[name]=bozen`).
      Searches through all textual fields, on the other hand, must not specify
      a field (e.g., `search=brixen`). If the server is unable process any
      search request, it shall respond with `400 Bad Request`.

      Notice: in OpenAPI version 3.0.3, Swagger does not support the
      specification of queries that can be serialized as either strings (e.g.,
      `search=brixen`) or objects (e.g., `search[name]=bozen`). This may limit
      the capabilities of the browser interface for building requests.
